# Hi there 👋

## Welcome to my github page!

I display all my projects right here for you to see!

### About 📝 

I'm Lite (relited) and I'm learning to code using a free course called The Odin Project https://theodinproject.com. I've been interested in learning to code for quite a while, I've tried languages such as Lua and Python but I wasn't really interested in them. A few months after attempting to learn those languages I discovered web development and completely fell in love.

### Stack 💻

I'm fairly proficient in HTML and CSS and I'm a beginner in JavaScript. In the future I hope to expand this stack and create many great things.

### Why❓

I'd like to become a fullstack developer and create a website that has an active userbase. Im also very interested in web development and I find learning new things and creating new things to be very fun.
