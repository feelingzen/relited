# Hi there 👋

## Welcome to my github page!

I display all my projects right here for you to see!

### About 📝 

I'm Lite (relited) and I'm learning to code using a free course called The Odin Project https://theodinproject.com. I've been interested in learning to code for quite a while, I've tried languages such as Lua and Python but I wasn't really interested in them. A few months after attempting to learn those languages I discovered web development and completely fell in love.

### Stack 💻

I'm proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Why❓

I'd like to become a fullstack developer and be able to create an income from my skills, I'd also like to build a website with an active userbase as I think it would be really cool to control something of that size.
